### With validation

Each child of `Form` has a property called `validate`.
It is not required but you can provide validations on it to be fired 
when your form is submitted.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-form--with-validation" />
</Canvas>

As you can see in the example above, we also provide some useful
validations:

<ValidationList/>

You can add as many validations as you want!

### With custom validation

You can write your custom validate function with custom error
messages.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="forms-form--with-custom-validation"      />
</Canvas>
