### With validation

Each child of `Form` has an property `validate`.
It is not required but you can provide validations on it to be fired 
when your form is submitted.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={WithValidation}/>
</Canvas>

As you can see in the example above, we also provide some useful
validations:

<ValidationList/>

You can add as many validations as you want!

### With custom validation

You can write your custom validate function with custom error
messages.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={WithCustomValidation}/>
</Canvas>
